# cleanUpMyPortrait
Remove scratches from a picture.

This program is a derivation of my previous program saltAndPepper.       
I made it to improve a colored picture of mine that had some scratches.  
It takes the color at the upper left corner and treats that as a key,    
then it scans the entire picture replacing the key with a neighbor color.

Thanks to my friend Robert Lopes, that kindly explained to me the salt and pepper noise reduction algorithm.
